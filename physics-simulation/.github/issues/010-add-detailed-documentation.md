# Issue: Add Detailed Documentation

## Description
This issue proposes creating detailed documentation for the physics simulation project. The documentation should cover the following aspects:

1. **Setup Instructions**: Provide clear steps on how to set up the project locally, including any dependencies that need to be installed and how to run the simulation.

2. **Usage Guidelines**: Explain how to use the simulation, including how to interact with the controls, what each parameter does, and how to create and manipulate bodies within the simulation.

3. **Feature Explanations**: Detail the features of the simulation, such as:
   - Gravitational interactions between bodies
   - Merging of bodies upon collision
   - Trail rendering and its customization
   - Future path prediction for bodies
   - Any additional features implemented in the project

4. **Code Structure Overview**: Provide an overview of the project's code structure, explaining the purpose of key files and modules, which will help new contributors understand the codebase quickly.

5. **Contribution Guidelines**: Outline how others can contribute to the project, including coding standards, how to submit issues, and the process for making pull requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documentation is written in Markdown format and is easy to read.
- All sections mentioned above are included and clearly explained.
- The documentation is added to the `README.md` file or a separate `DOCUMENTATION.md` file in the project root, as appropriate.
- Links to relevant sections of the documentation are provided within the README for easy navigation.

## Additional Notes
- Consider using examples and screenshots where applicable to enhance understanding.
- Ensure that the documentation is kept up-to-date with any future changes to the project.
