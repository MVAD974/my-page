# Improve Trail Rendering Performance

## Description
This issue aims to optimize the rendering of trails for bodies in the simulation. Currently, the performance may degrade with a large number of bodies and their trails, especially when the maximum trail length is set high. 

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Limit Trail Points**: Implement a mechanism to limit the number of trail points stored for each body. For example, only keep the last N points instead of all points.
  
2. **Efficient Drawing Techniques**: Explore more efficient drawing techniques, such as:
   - Using a single path for drawing trails instead of multiple individual points.
   - Implementing a batching system to reduce the number of draw calls.

3. **Adjustable Trail Opacity**: Allow users to adjust the opacity of trails dynamically, which could help in reducing the visual clutter and improve performance.

4. **Trail Simplification**: Consider simplifying the trail rendering by reducing the number of segments drawn based on the speed of the body. Faster bodies could have fewer trail points rendered.

5. **Performance Testing**: Conduct performance tests to measure the impact of these changes and ensure that the simulation remains responsive even with many bodies.

## Benefits
- Improved performance during simulations with many bodies.
- Enhanced user experience by maintaining smooth rendering.
- Reduced memory usage by limiting the number of trail points stored.

## Additional Notes
- Consider profiling the current rendering performance to identify bottlenecks.
- Collaborate with other contributors to gather insights on potential optimizations.
