## Issue Title: Add Menu for Changing Variables

### Description
This issue suggests creating a user-friendly menu that allows users to easily change simulation parameters such as the gravitational constant, time rate, body mass, and trail length without needing to interact with sliders. The goal is to enhance the user experience by providing a more intuitive interface for adjusting these variables.

### Proposed Features
1. **Dropdown Menus**: Implement dropdown menus for selecting values for gravitational constant and time rate, allowing users to choose from predefined options.
2. **Input Fields**: Provide input fields for body mass and trail length, enabling users to enter specific values directly.
3. **Real-time Updates**: Ensure that changes made in the menu are reflected in the simulation in real-time, enhancing interactivity.
4. **Reset to Defaults**: Include a button to reset all parameters to their default values for convenience.

### Benefits
- Simplifies the process of changing simulation parameters.
- Improves accessibility for users who may find sliders cumbersome.
- Enhances overall user experience by providing a more organized interface.

### Additional Notes
- Consider the layout of the menu to ensure it fits well within the existing UI.
- Ensure that the new menu is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
