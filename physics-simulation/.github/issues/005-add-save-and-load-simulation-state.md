# Issue: Add Save and Load Simulation State

## Description
This issue suggests implementing a feature that allows users to save the current state of the simulation, including the positions, velocities, and parameters of all bodies, and load it later. This functionality will enhance the user experience by enabling users to pause their work and return to it without losing progress.

## Proposed Features
1. **Save Functionality**:
   - Create a button that, when clicked, serializes the current state of the simulation (positions, velocities, masses, colors, and simulation parameters) and saves it to the local storage or a downloadable file.
   - Ensure that the saved state can be easily restored later.

2. **Load Functionality**:
   - Create a button that allows users to load a previously saved simulation state.
   - Implement a file input that lets users select a saved file from their device.
   - Upon loading, the simulation should restore all bodies to their saved positions, velocities, and parameters.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Add buttons for "Save Simulation" and "Load Simulation" to the existing controls overlay.
   - Provide feedback to the user upon successful save or load actions (e.g., notifications or alerts).

## Benefits
- Users can save their progress and return to it later, making the simulation more user-friendly and practical for extended sessions.
- This feature will encourage experimentation, as users can try different scenarios without the fear of losing their previous work.

## Additional Considerations
- Ensure that the save and load functionality is robust and handles errors gracefully (e.g., invalid files, corrupted data).
- Consider implementing versioning for saved states to accommodate future changes in the simulation's data structure.
