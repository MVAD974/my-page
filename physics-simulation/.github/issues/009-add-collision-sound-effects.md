# Issue: Add Collision Sound Effects

## Description
This issue requests the implementation of sound effects that play when bodies collide in the simulation. Adding auditory feedback will enhance the user experience by providing a more immersive and interactive environment.

## Requirements
- Integrate a sound library or use the Web Audio API to handle sound playback.
- Choose or create sound effects that are appropriate for collisions (e.g., a "thud" or "bang" sound).
- Ensure that sound effects are played only when two bodies collide.
- Provide options in the settings menu to enable or disable sound effects.

## Tasks
1. Research and select suitable sound effects for collisions.
2. Implement sound playback functionality in the simulation code.
3. Modify the collision detection logic to trigger sound effects upon collision.
4. Add a toggle option in the controls menu to enable/disable sound effects.
5. Test the implementation to ensure sound plays correctly during collisions.

## Additional Notes
- Consider the volume and frequency of sound effects to avoid overwhelming the user.
- Ensure that sound effects are compatible with different browsers and devices.
- Document the sound effect feature in the project's README file.
