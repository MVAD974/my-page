# Physics Simulation

## Overview
The Physics Simulation project is an interactive web-based simulation that visualizes gravitational interactions between bodies in a two-dimensional space. Users can create bodies, adjust simulation parameters, and observe the effects of gravity in real-time.

## Features
- **Interactive Bodies**: Users can add bodies with customizable mass, color, and velocity.
- **Gravitational Simulation**: The simulation calculates gravitational forces between bodies, allowing for realistic motion.
- **Trails**: Bodies leave trails behind them, providing a visual history of their movement.
- **Future Path Prediction**: Users can see the predicted future paths of bodies before they are added to the simulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/physics-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd physics-simulation
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to run the simulation.

## Usage
- Use the controls at the bottom of the screen to adjust simulation parameters such as gravitational constant, time rate, body mass, and trail length.
- Click and drag on the canvas to create new bodies, adjusting their initial velocity based on the drag distance.
- Observe the gravitational interactions and the resulting motion of the bodies.
